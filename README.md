# Majorana Neutrino Hunt
Capstone Project B10

The goal of this project is to develop parameters that will be extracted from the time series data provided to us publicly by the Majorana Demonstrator experiement in order to propose machine learning models that meet the requirements outlined in the Neutrino Physics and Machine Learning (NPML) instructions included in the Majorana Demonstrator data release notes.

## Description
This repository contains all the functions for parameters that will be used to train machine learning models. 

The parameters used in this investigation include:

- Drift Time (tdrift)
- Late Charge (LQ80)
- Late Charge Slope 
- Second derivative Inflection Points
- Rising Edge Slope
- Rising Edge Asymmetry
- Current Amplitude
- Tail Slope
- Delayed Charge Recovery (DCR)
- Fourier Transform (lfpr)
- Energy Peak
